# password-generator
The purpose of this application will be to generate a strong password using parameters selected by the User.

The User is intially presented with a screen that holds a text box and a "Generate password" button. Upon clicking the button, the user will be guided through a series of prompts defining the parameters of the password (number of characters, uppercase, lowercase, etc).  

Upon selecting the desired parameters, a password will be generated in the text box and be available for the user to copy.
